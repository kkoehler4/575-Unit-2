          <h6>Migration</h6> Monarch butterflies are well known for their unique migration patterrns, as the only
          butterfly to make a two-way migration. Western Monarchs that live in the Rocky Mountains overwinter
          on the Pacific Coast of California. They begin to arrive at these sites in September and, after breeding at
          the overwintering site, depart in February and March. 
      <h6>Habitat</h6> Milkweed and other native flowering plants are essential Western Monarch 
      habitat. They feed on the nectar of many flowers, and only breed where milkweed can be found. 
      As milkweed is the host plant of monarch butterflies, they rely on this one plant as their 
      larval food source. Therefore, without milkweed, monarchs cannot survive.
        <h6>Population Decline</h6> The intense population decline of the Western Monarch has been 
        attributed to three main factors: habitat loss, pesticide use, and climate change.
